Additional Editor Comments (if provided):

Your paper is interesting and would add to the literature, however it is not publishable in its current form. 
Please take careful consideration of each of the reviewers' comments and pay particular attention to grammar, acronyms, 
and making your figures and tables as easy to understand as possible. In particular, your data would be much more helpful 
if you were to show country/regional differences and your methodology needs to be more clear.

5. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments 
for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your 
review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: This is an interesting paper about whether or not male circumcision leads to increased risk behavior 
in several sub-Saharan countries. The paper is well written. I have several comments and suggestions.

1 Abstract - first paragraph please use the past tense
* done

2 Abstract and rest of paper - you switch back and forth between WHO and UN. Can you be more consistent?
* done.  We kept WHO in stead of using both names synomously.

3 Abstract – Can you add one more sentence at the end with ‘this suggests’ and/or a recommendation on what we should do 
with this information? Sell me your results!


4 Conclusion – You have only one suggestion at the end of your paper about media literacy. Wouldn’t you want to end this 
paper with a few more punches? It seems to me that these are encouraging results? You may want to state that here.

5 Tables S1 and S2 – The sequence of the data in the sections Education and Religion could be changed. In education it 
would make sense to put Higher at the bottom. In Regilion it would make sense to move ‘other Christian’ below ‘Christian’

6 Throughout – Is SRB a standard abbreviation? You use a lot of abbreviations in this paper. That does not improve 
readability imho.

7 Methods – It seems to me that you have a large dataset. What you show here is that overall there was no increase 
in sexual risk behavior in these countries. That is great, but isn’t there more information here? Why didn’t 
you also do these analyses per country? I’m sure there must be differences between countries? When I glance 
at the table I see differences in religion, condom use, employment, male circumcision status. This would help 
national programs, and other countries could learn from it. You could provide all of these results as a supplement, 
and mention the highlights in the paper. Even if you don’t think this makes any sense I would like you to mention 
that and explain why it wouldn’t. Some of the data from the tables could be illustrated in bar graphs highlighting 
differences over time and between countries.

Overall I think this is an interesting paper on an important topic. But I feel that there could be more in your dataset 
than what you present here. I would like you do a bit more work, as outlined in comment 7, and resubmit your paper after that.

Reviewer #2: This analysis targets an important question regarding sexual risk compensation in circumcised men, 
and uses publicly available, existing data to tackle the question. However several key methodological issues stand out:

1. Need to indicate somewhere that this analysis is assumed to pertain to a heterosexual population. Some justification 
for this is likely in order.

2. Incomplete efficacy of MC is not the only reason that sexual risk compensation should be of public health concern. 
Recommendations pertaining to any preventative tool need to be understood in the context of its real world effectiveness.

3. Paragraph 2 in the “Background” section: Existing evidence on MC and risk compensation is poorly presented. It is 
unclear if the cited studies pertain to populations with an inherent heterogeneity in circumcision prevalence, as opposed 
to populations that have undergone an explicit MC interventions for HIV prevention.

4. How are “non-marital” sex partners defined in a survey that distinguishes between formal and informal marriages?

5. What is “media use” and how is it thought to relate to sexual risk behaviors?

6. It is not clear how the authors know that men indicated as “circumcised” in the DHS are those who took part in an 
HIV prevention effort, versus those circumcised for religious (or personal) reasons (i.e. areas with large Muslim populations).

7. Study design is unclear: how many surveys per country are included, and in what year were they conducted? Are data 
from all surveys years before and after 2008 pooled to represent the “pre” and “post” data? Do the authors not care about 
differences in *trends* in the pre- and post-intervention period?
 * Trends? Will citing WHO's progress report by nation sufficient? 
 
8. Secular trends that could separately explain differences in pre-2008 and post-2008 samples are not addressed. Given 
the substantial efficacy of other biomedical interventions like treatment as prevention and preexposure prophylaxis that 
have been rolled out in the same time period, it is difficult to believe that all differences observed in the two 
time periods could be solely attributable to a single policy recommendation concerning MC. Similarly, the authors 
might consider a lag period following the WHO/UNAIDS recommendation before countries reached adequate MC service 
provision capacity.
 * This is a very good point and we will address it in our disccusion and limits.  Also, we will cite
 the WHO's VMMC progress report by nation into our discussion.
 
9. Analytic approach is inadequately explained. “Relative OR’s” are not an effect measure I have come across in 
any epidemiology textbook or manuscript. Is it the ratio of two OR’s? If so, it’s unclear why this analytic method 
is preferable to a simple regression of the response on time. It’s also unclear what the author means by stating 
that s/he is “analyzing the interaction of MC association with SRB…”

10. The models used to generate the associations between covariates of interest and the two sexual behavior related 
outcomes are insufficiently explained. It is suggested that model output with and without the covariate in question 
were compared (to compare model fit?) but how this provides a more informative estimate of the association is unclear. 
Univariable associations are usually adequate for exploratory analyses like these.

11. Hypothesized reasons for the upward trend in reported condom use are not discussed; citing other publications 
provides context but not an explanation.


Style & Presentation Issues
• Language is problematic throughout the paper. Needs rewriting in many sections.
• Too many unhelpful acronyms for non-standard phrases (SRB, SRC, VMMC, etc.).
• The results section is just figure legends, no real results.
• Tables and Figures aren’t titled nor labeled so unclear to which graphic the text is referring.
• Tables: Descriptive sample information should likely be in the main body of the paper, not the supplement. 
Labels for most of the variables are impossible to decipher (e.g. “Knowledge healthy get AIDS”). No statistical tests 
were performed to compare proportions across subgroups of interest.
• Figures look unfinished, like raw analyses. Axes labels are not informative (what is “partner year?”), and figures 
lack captions and titles. Variable names are difficult to understand; need to be clearly defined in the text.
