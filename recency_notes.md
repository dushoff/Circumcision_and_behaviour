Background
==

* We will add Ethiopia 2011 and Zimbabwe (2015) to the data.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available.
* The variables in the models are basically the same from the status models:  
  
  * main responses:  condom use, partner year and partner life
  * main predictors: MC category, when MCed.  We don't use age of MC because it conflates the when MCed.
  * other factors:  media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status
  * random factors:  country, cluster, plus media

* I like to compare the differences of the countries.  Compared to anaylzing an overall analysis of MC on SRB in the status model, I wonder if we can 

* I also like to include MC prevalence in the models.  My presumption is that MC prevalence correlate with the idea of MC protection against HIV, therefore their SRB.

* Do we want to study partner lifetime? Maybe not.  It's not clear how we can make sense of numbers of lifetime partners mean in terms of time span.

* Tanzania 2015-6 is available, but it has condom use, but not numbers of sexual partners by last year and lifetime.  Do we want to replace it with the 2010 data which has all the three variables?
