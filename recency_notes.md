* There are 10 nations in our study:  Kenya (ke7-2014), Lesotho (ls7-2014), Malawi (mw6-2010), Mozambique (mz6-2011), Nambia (nm6-2013), Rwanda (rw7-2014-5), Tanzania (tz6-2010), Uganda (ug6-2011), Zambia (zm6-2013-4), Zimbabwe (zw7-2015).

  * We updated Zimbabwe from 2011 to 2015.  We did not use the lastest Tanzania (2015-6) data because it did not have hiv knowledge.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available; and only Gambela in Ethiopia is under the scale-up promotion, therefore they are also excluded in our study.
  
* The variables in the models are basically the same from the status models:  
  
  * main responses:  condom use, and partner year.  We decided not to use numbers of partners in lifetime.  It is a varabile we dont' know how to interpret it because numbers could skew in the earlier time before the campaign started.
  * main predictors: MC category, when MCed.
  * other factors:  country, media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status)
      * We decided to keep country as a fixed variable to study the difference among countries.
  * random factors:  cluster, plus media

* no MC prevalence.  Instead, we will put country as a fixed variable.
