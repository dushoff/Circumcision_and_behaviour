* We will add Ethiopia 2011 to the data.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available.
* The variables in the models are basically the same:  
  ** main responses:  condom use, partner year and partner life
  ** main predictors: MC category, age of MC
  ** other factors:  media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status
  ** random factors:  country, cluster, 

* Do we need age of MC since we already have age?

* Can we compare the differences of the countries?  

* How workable is it if we include MC prevalence in the models?

* Do we want to study partner life?
