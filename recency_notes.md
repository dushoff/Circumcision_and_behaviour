Background 12/20/16
==

* We will add Ethiopia 2011, Tanzania (2015-6) and Zimbabwe (2015) to the data.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available.
    * J will upload the data by the end of 2016.
  
* The variables in the models are basically the same from the status models:  
  
  * main responses:  condom use, and partner year.  We decided not to use numbers of partners in lifetime.  It is a varabile we dont' know how to interpret it because numbers could skew in the earlier time before the campaign started.
  * main predictors: MC category, when MCed.
  * other factors:  country, media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status)
      * We decided to keep country as a fixed variable to study the difference among countries.
  * random factors:  cluster, plus media

* no MC prevalence.  Instead, we will put country as a fixed variable.

* Tanzania 2015-6 is available, but it has only condom use, but not numbers of sexual partners by last year and lifetime.  Do we want to replace it with the 2010 data which has all the three variables?
  * C will investigate more:  2015 vs. 2010 vs. both by 12/21/16
