* We will add Ethiopia 2011 and Zimbabwe (2015) to the data.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available.
* The variables in the models are basically the same from the status models:  
  
  * main responses:  condom use, partner year and partner life
  * main predictors: MC category, when MCed.  We don't use age of MC because it conflates the when MCed.
  * other factors:  media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status
  * random factors:  country, cluster, plus media

* I like to compare the differences of the countries.  Compared to anaylzing an overall analysis of MC on SRB in the status model, I wonder if we can 

* To include MC prevalence in the models?  My presumption is that MC prevalence is a result of governments' scale-up plans, and the scale-up plan affects MC receiver's perception of MC protection, therefore is an index on SRB.

* Do we want to study partner life?
