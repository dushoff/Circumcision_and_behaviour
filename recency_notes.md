* There are 10 nations with 11 datasets in our study:  Kenya (ke7-2014), Lesotho (ls7-2014), Malawi (mw6-2010), Mozambique (mz6-2011), Nambia (nm6-2013), Rwanda (rw7-2014-5), Tanzania (tz6-2010 and tz7-2015-6), Uganda (ug6-2011), Zambia (zm6-2013-4), Zimbabwe (zw7-2015).

  * We added Tanzania (2015-6) and updated Zimbabwe from 2011 to 2015.  Baswana, Swaziland and South Africa have no post-2007 surveys available; and only Gambela in Ethiopia is under the scale-up promotion, therefore also excluded in our study.

  * Since Tanzania 2015-6 has no data on sexual partners, we decided to use the 2015-6 data for condom analyais and 2010 for the sexual partner analyais.  We could use 2010 data for both analyses, but it makes more sense to use the latest data when available.  We believe that SRB are more settled in the newer survey.
  
* The variables in the models are basically the same from the status models:  
  
  * main responses:  condom use, and partner year.  We decided not to use numbers of partners in lifetime.  It is a varabile we dont' know how to interpret it because numbers could skew in the earlier time before the campaign started.
  * main predictors: MC category, when MCed.
  * other factors:  country, media use, HIV knowledge and socio demographics (age, education, job, area, religion, wealth, marital status)
      * We decided to keep country as a fixed variable to study the difference among countries.
  * random factors:  cluster, plus media

* no MC prevalence.  Instead, we will put country as a fixed variable.
